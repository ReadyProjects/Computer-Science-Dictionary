Computer Science Dictionary
It seems like you're requesting information on the abstract and module of a Computer Science Dictionary. However, I'd like to clarify that the term "abstract" can have different meanings depending on the context. In the context of a dictionary or computer science, "abstract" might refer to abstract data types, abstract classes, or abstract syntax, among other possibilities.

As for "module," it can refer to a variety of concepts in computer science. It might denote a software module, a hardware module, or even a programming module. Each of these has its own specific meaning and context.

Since your question is a bit broad, I'll provide a general explanation for both terms:

### Abstract (in the context of computer science):

1. **Abstract Data Type (ADT):**
   - An abstract data type is a high-level description of a set of operations that can be performed on a data structure, without specifying how those operations are implemented. Examples include stacks, queues, and lists.

2. **Abstract Class:**
   - In object-oriented programming, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may contain abstract methods (methods without a defined implementation). It serves as a blueprint for other classes.

3. **Abstract Syntax:**
   - Abstract syntax refers to the abstract representation of the syntactic structure of source code in a programming language. It focuses on the hierarchical structure of the code without detailing the specific syntax.

### Module (in the context of computer science):

1. **Software Module:**
   - A software module is a self-contained unit of code that performs a specific set of functions. It is designed to be reusable, modular, and can be integrated into a larger program. Modules help in organizing and structuring code.

2. **Hardware Module:**
   - In hardware design, a module can refer to a discrete unit or component that performs a specific function. For example, in digital design, a module might be a circuit that performs arithmetic operations.

3. **Programming Module:**
   - In programming, a module is a file or a collection of files containing code that can be reused across different parts of a program. Modules help in organizing code and facilitate code reuse.

If you have a more specific question about a particular aspect of abstract or module in computer science, please provide additional details, and I'll do my best to assist you.

Brief overview of the technology
1.	HTML: HTML is used to create and save web document. E.g. Notepad/Notepad++
